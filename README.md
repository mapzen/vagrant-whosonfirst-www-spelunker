# whosonfirst-www-spelunker-vagrant

Everything - all the data, all the indexing, all the search - you need to run
the Who's On First spelunker locally.

This is a work in progress. It hasn't really been tested yet. That's why it's in
the `mapzen` bucket. Once it actually works it will be in the `whosonfirst`
bucket.
